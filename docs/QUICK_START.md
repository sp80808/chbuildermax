# ChordSeqM4L Quick Start

## 1. Installation

The ChordSeqM4L device now runs a self-contained AI engine. For it to function, you need the entire project folder, not just the `.amxd` file.

1.  Place the entire `chbuildermax` project folder in a location you can access from Ableton Live.
2.  Inside Ableton, you can locate the `chordseqm4l.amxd` file via Max's file browser or add the project folder to your Places in Live's browser.
3.  For the AI features to work, you must first follow the **[AI Integration Setup Guide](./AI_SETUP_GUIDE.md)**.

## 2. Basic Usage
1.  Create a MIDI track in Ableton Live.
2.  Add the ChordSeqM4L device to the track.
3.  **Use AI Suggestions**:
    *   Select an AI model from the dropdown menu in the device.
    *   Click on a chord in the timeline. The AI will automatically generate a sequence of suggested chords that follow it.
4.  **Manual Editing**: Click the "+" button to add chords manually or edit the AI's suggestions.
5.  Press the spacebar to play your progression.
